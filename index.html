			<p>My first experience with web design and development occurred a number of years ago when a friend of mine realised I knew my way around a computer and asked me to redesign the website for his engineering company.</p> 
			<p>Having no experience of web design or HTML I said that I would give it a go and if he liked the results then I would continue on the project.  After purchasing and reading a Dummies guide, utilising a WYSIWYG editor, and a graphics program I completed a design with which he was happy with.</p>
			<p>At the time if there was no such thing as Codecademy or any of the extensive free resources that are avaliable today, and it was frustrating to learn the hard way that a design in one browser would display differently for no obvious reason.</p>
			<p>Fast forward to mid 2014 - I joined Codecademy after reading about how they were offering free courses to learn markup and coding languages.</p> 
			<p>At the tail end of 2015 I decided to pursue a career in web development after finding the website http://developajob.com/ and being inspired by the story of its creator Robert Stowe.</p>
			<p>At present I am looking to build on my basic experience and a chance to learn more and improve my skills. </p>
